This repo contains `.nfc` files to be used with Flipper Zero. Just place them in your `nfc` folder, and then emulate them.

***Note: Reading/emulating SLIX-L chips is a fairly new addition to the official Flipper Zero firmware (as of `0.99.1`), so make sure you are on that version or newer. I'm not sure about unoffical firmwares and which versions support this yet.***

Pull requests welcome!
