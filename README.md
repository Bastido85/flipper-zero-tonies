This repo contains `.nfc` files to be used with Flipper Zero. Just place them in your `nfc` folder, and then emulate them.

Pull requests welcome!

**Notes**

*  Reading/emulating SLIX-L chips is a fairly new addition to the official Flipper Zero firmware. It disappeared for a few releases and came back as of `0.99.1` (with a different file format), so make sure you are on that version or newer. I'm not sure about unofficial firmwares and which versions support this yet.
* The Tonie Box downloads the audio data from servers, so it is possible that the data in this repo no longer works at some point. Keep that in mind if you are uploading your kid's cherished figures.
